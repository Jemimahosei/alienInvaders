# Alien Invaders | Python Game Project - November 2023

**Note:** I cannot provide code and very detailed information about this assignment due to possible violations of Academic Integrity and copyright policy of my school.

## Project Overview

For my final assignment in CS 1110, I developed a Python-based clone of the classic arcade game Space Invaders. This project required implementing core features such as animations, sound effects, and collision detection, while adhering to strict coding standards. 

Key elements of the project included:
- Implementing dynamic animations and sound effects for a more engaging player experience.
- Utilizing a reusable code structure with helper functions and well-defined classes, leading to over 500 lines of maintainable code.
- Gaining hands-on experience in developing an interactive application and managing an open-ended project from start to finish.

## Game Assignment Context

The final project in CS 1110 is always focused on game development, consolidating everything we have learned into one cohesive task. The assignment this year was to create a clone of Space Invaders, a well-known arcade game. The project scope was open-ended, allowing for creativity in adding features beyond the basic gameplay.

The base functionality required creating a single wave of aliens, but I was encouraged to go beyond this with extra features. This challenge required careful planning, incremental programming, and thorough testing.

## Development Process

The project was broken into manageable stages to ensure steady progress throughout the timeline:
1. **Basic Wave Implementation**: Created a single wave of Space Invaders, ensuring basic game mechanics were functional.
2. **Animation & Sound**: Implemented alien movement animations and sound effects for events like firing and explosions.
3. **Collision Detection**: Developed the logic for handling collisions between the player's ship, alien projectiles, and the defense barriers.
4. **Extra Features** (optional for extra credit):
   - **Multiple Waves**: Introduced multiple waves of aliens, increasing the game difficulty with each wave.
   - **Score System**: Added a score-tracking mechanism that rewarded players based on the positions of the destroyed aliens.

## Challenges & Learning Outcomes

This project presented several challenges:
- **Managing Complexity**: With over 500 lines of code, structuring the project to maintain readability and flexibility was crucial. This was achieved by organizing the code into multiple classes and methods.
- **Game Design Concepts**: Implementing animations, dynamic alien behavior, and player interactions deepened my understanding of interactive programming.
- **Incremental Development**: I learned the importance of breaking down large projects into smaller, testable components, ensuring the game was functional at each stage before adding new features.

## Conclusion

The Alien Invaders project was a significant learning experience that allowed me to apply theoretical concepts from class to a real-world project. By successfully completing this assignment, I enhanced my skills in Python programming, object-oriented design, and game development. The final game, while simple, is a fun and interactive clone of the classic Space Invaders, with room for further expansion and features.
